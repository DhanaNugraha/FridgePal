Perfect 👨‍🍳👩‍🍳 — let’s turn your **“multiple chefs” ensemble idea** into a practical design for **FridgePal**.
We’ll build it step by step:

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Split the dataset into chunks

Let’s say you have a big CSV (`recipes.csv`) with millions of recipes. We’ll split it into smaller files (or subsets in memory).

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the full dataset
df = pd.read_csv("recipes.csv", usecols=["title", "ingredients", "instructions"]).dropna()

# Example: split into 5 chefs
num_chefs = 5
chunk_size = len(df) // num_chefs

chefs_data = [df.iloc[i*chunk_size:(i+1)*chunk_size] for i in range(num_chefs)]
```

Now we have 5 smaller datasets → each will be handled by its own “chef”.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Train a TF-IDF model per chef

Each chef gets their own `TfidfVectorizer` trained on its portion of the recipes.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

vectorizers = []
matrices = []

for chef_df in chefs_data:
    vec = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words="english")
    X = vec.fit_transform(chef_df["ingredients"])
    
    vectorizers.append(vec)
    matrices.append(X)
```

So now:

* `vectorizers[i]` = the ingredient vocabulary for Chef `i`.
* `matrices[i]` = the TF-IDF matrix for Chef `i`’s recipes.

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Query all chefs

When a user gives ingredients, you ask **all chefs** for their best matches.

```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def query_chefs(user_ingredients, top_n=3):
    results = []
    user_query = " ".join(user_ingredients)

    for i, chef_df in enumerate(chefs_data):
        user_vec = vectorizers[i].transform([user_query])
        scores = cosine_similarity(user_vec, matrices[i]).flatten()
        
        top_idx = scores.argsort()[-top_n:][::-1]
        
        for idx in top_idx:
            recipe = chef_df.iloc[idx]
            results.append({
                "chef": f"Chef {i+1}",
                "title": recipe["title"],
                "score": float(scores[idx]),
                "required_ingredients": recipe["ingredients"].split(","),
                "instructions": recipe["instructions"].split(". ")
            })
    
    # Merge & sort results from all chefs
    results = sorted(results, key=lambda x: x["score"], reverse=True)
    return results[:top_n * len(chefs_data)]
```

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Example usage

```python
user_input = ["chicken", "tomato", "onion"]

recommendations = query_chefs(user_input, top_n=2)

for rec in recommendations:
    print(f"{rec['chef']} suggests: {rec['title']} (score={rec['score']:.2f})")
```

Output might look like:

```
Chef 2 suggests: Tomato Chicken Curry (score=0.87)
Chef 5 suggests: Chicken Stew with Onions (score=0.83)
Chef 1 suggests: Tomato Pasta with Veggies (score=0.75)
Chef 3 suggests: Grilled Onion Chicken (score=0.74)
...
```

---

## 🔹 Step 5: FridgePal Storytelling (Optional but fun!)

Instead of just merging results, you can make each “chef” feel like a personality:

* Chef 1 → Italian cuisine (trained on chunk with many pasta/pizza recipes)
* Chef 2 → Asian cuisine
* Chef 3 → Vegan/Vegetarian
* Chef 4 → Comfort food / American classics
* Chef 5 → Dessert specialist

Then in the UI:

* Each card could show **“Chef 3 suggests…”** for more flavor 🥳

---

## ⚡ Summary

✔️ You split the dataset → train multiple lightweight models.
✔️ Each model gives **its own picks**.
✔️ You merge + rerank results → feels like a **panel of chefs** helping the user.
✔️ Keeps memory low (each model handles a slice, not all 2M recipes).
