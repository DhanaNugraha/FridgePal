Perfect üë®‚Äçüç≥üë©‚Äçüç≥ ‚Äî let‚Äôs turn your **‚Äúmultiple chefs‚Äù ensemble idea** into a practical design for **FridgePal**.
We‚Äôll build it step by step:

---

## üîπ Step 1: Split the dataset into chunks

Let‚Äôs say you have a big CSV (`recipes.csv`) with millions of recipes. We‚Äôll split it into smaller files (or subsets in memory).

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the full dataset
df = pd.read_csv("recipes.csv", usecols=["title", "ingredients", "instructions"]).dropna()

# Example: split into 5 chefs
num_chefs = 5
chunk_size = len(df) // num_chefs

chefs_data = [df.iloc[i*chunk_size:(i+1)*chunk_size] for i in range(num_chefs)]
```

Now we have 5 smaller datasets ‚Üí each will be handled by its own ‚Äúchef‚Äù.

---

## üîπ Step 2: Train a TF-IDF model per chef

Each chef gets their own `TfidfVectorizer` trained on its portion of the recipes.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

vectorizers = []
matrices = []

for chef_df in chefs_data:
    vec = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words="english")
    X = vec.fit_transform(chef_df["ingredients"])
    
    vectorizers.append(vec)
    matrices.append(X)
```

So now:

* `vectorizers[i]` = the ingredient vocabulary for Chef `i`.
* `matrices[i]` = the TF-IDF matrix for Chef `i`‚Äôs recipes.

---

## üîπ Step 3: Query all chefs with Hybrid Scoring

When a user provides ingredients, each chef calculates both TF-IDF similarity and ingredient overlap, then combines them for a more balanced recommendation.

```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

def normalize_ingredient(ing: str) -> str:
    """Normalize ingredient names for better matching."""
    return ' '.join(ing.lower().strip().split())

def calculate_overlap(query_ingredients, recipe_ingredients):
    """Calculate the ingredient overlap score between query and recipe."""
    query_set = {normalize_ingredient(ing) for ing in query_ingredients}
    recipe_set = {normalize_ingredient(ing) for ing in recipe_ingredients.split(',')}
    
    if not recipe_set:
        return 0.0
    return len(query_set & recipe_set) / len(recipe_set)

def query_chefs(user_ingredients, top_n=3, cosine_weight=0.5):
    """
    Get recipe recommendations using hybrid scoring.
    
    Args:
        user_ingredients: List of available ingredients
        top_n: Number of recommendations per chef
        cosine_weight: Weight for TF-IDF vs. overlap (0.0 to 1.0)
    """
    results = []
    user_query = " ".join(user_ingredients)

    for i, chef_df in enumerate(chefs_data):
        # TF-IDF similarity
        user_vec = vectorizers[i].transform([user_query])
        cosine_scores = cosine_similarity(user_vec, matrices[i]).flatten()
        
        # Normalize cosine scores
        if len(cosine_scores) > 1:
            cosine_scores = (cosine_scores - cosine_scores.min()) / \
                          (cosine_scores.max() - cosine_scores.min() + 1e-9)
        
        # Calculate overlap scores
        overlap_scores = np.array([
            calculate_overlap(user_ingredients, recipe["ingredients"])
            for _, recipe in chef_df.iterrows()
        ])
        
        # Combine scores
        hybrid_scores = (cosine_weight * cosine_scores) + \
                       ((1 - cosine_weight) * overlap_scores)
        
        # Get top N recommendations
        top_idx = hybrid_scores.argsort()[-top_n:][::-1]
        
        for idx in top_idx:
            recipe = chef_df.iloc[idx]
            results.append({
                "chef": f"Chef {i+1}",
                "title": recipe["title"],
                "score": float(hybrid_scores[idx]),
                "score_components": {
                    "cosine_score": float(cosine_scores[idx]),
                    "overlap_score": float(overlap_scores[idx]),
                    "cosine_weight": cosine_weight,
                    "overlap_weight": 1 - cosine_weight
                },
                "required_ingredients": recipe["ingredients"].split(","),
                "instructions": recipe["instructions"].split(". ")
            })
    
    # Merge & sort results from all chefs
    results.sort(key=lambda x: x["score"], reverse=True)
    return results[:top_n * len(chefs_data)]
```

---

## üîπ Step 4: Example Usage with Hybrid Scoring

```python
user_input = ["chicken", "tomato", "onion", "garlic"]

# Get recommendations with default 50/50 weighting
recommendations = query_chefs(user_input, top_n=2)

# Or adjust the balance (e.g., 70% TF-IDF, 30% overlap)
# recommendations = query_chefs(user_input, top_n=2, cosine_weight=0.7)

for i, rec in enumerate(recommendations, 1):
    scores = rec['score_components']
    print(f"{i}. {rec['chef']} suggests: {rec['title']}")
    print(f"   Final Score: {rec['score']:.2f}")
    print(f"   TF-IDF: {scores['cosine_score']:.2f} (weight: {scores['cosine_weight']*100:.0f}%)")
    print(f"   Overlap: {scores['overlap_score']:.2f} (weight: {scores['overlap_weight']*100:.0f}%)")
    print()
```

Example output:

```
1. Chef 2 (Asian) suggests: Tomato Chicken Curry
   Final Score: 0.85
   TF-IDF: 0.70 (weight: 50%)
   Overlap: 1.00 (weight: 50%)

2. Chef 5 (Dessert) suggests: Chicken Stew with Onions
   Final Score: 0.82
   TF-IDF: 0.65 (weight: 50%)
   Overlap: 0.99 (weight: 50%)

3. Chef 1 (Italian) suggests: Tomato Pasta with Veggies
   Final Score: 0.78
   TF-IDF: 0.75 (weight: 50%)
   Overlap: 0.81 (weight: 50%)
```

## üîπ Step 5: FridgePal Storytelling (Optional but fun!)

Instead of just merging results, you can make each ‚Äúchef‚Äù feel like a personality:

* Chef 1 ‚Üí Italian cuisine (trained on chunk with many pasta/pizza recipes)
* Chef 2 ‚Üí Asian cuisine
* Chef 3 ‚Üí Vegan/Vegetarian
* Chef 4 ‚Üí Comfort food / American classics
* Chef 5 ‚Üí Dessert specialist

Then in the UI:

* Each card could show **‚ÄúChef 3 suggests‚Ä¶‚Äù** for more flavor ü•≥

## ‚ö° Summary

‚úîÔ∏è You split the dataset ‚Üí train multiple lightweight models.
‚úîÔ∏è Each model uses **hybrid scoring** (TF-IDF + ingredient overlap) for better recommendations.
‚úîÔ∏è Customizable weights let you balance between semantic similarity and ingredient matching.
‚úîÔ∏è You merge + rerank results ‚Üí feels like a **panel of chefs** helping the user.
‚úîÔ∏è Keeps memory low (each model handles a slice, not all 2M recipes).
‚úîÔ∏è Detailed score breakdown helps understand why each recipe was recommended.
